 * Calendar connection state for the dashboard card (L10, issue #246).
 *
 * ## The whole point: this is a function of the server's rows
 *
 * `deriveConnectionState` takes the parsed `GET /v1/connections` payload
 * and nothing else. It has no access to local storage, to a React state
 * flag, or to "did the user just click connect" — because #213 was exactly
 * that: a disconnect button that reported success from device-local memory
 * while the backend went on reading the user's calendar. The user was told
 * one thing and the truth was another, and no test caught it because the
 * local state was self-consistent.
 *
 * Making the derivation a pure function of the server payload means the
 * card cannot display a state the server did not report. There is no
 * parameter through which a local guess could enter.
